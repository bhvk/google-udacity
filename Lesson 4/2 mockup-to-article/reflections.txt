You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

---

* learnt - HTML elements, Document Tree, Various tags.
* understanding MDN reference and coding from there has been easy.
* playing with figures and images and alignment has been difficult.
* after learning to solve an issue using documentation now I overcome a new challenge by just going to the official MDN references and clear my doubt.
